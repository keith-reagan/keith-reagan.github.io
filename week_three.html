				<center><h3>Week 3 - sed, awk, and the nightmares they brought</h3></center><br>
				<p>I wasn't familiar with sed or awk before starting the class, looking at the requests for the data on the assignments I didn't think it would be too bad. I was horribly mistaken. I'm still working on one final part of the awk assignment, that one being making the actual awk script. I've been able to get everything working on the single command line but still haven't worked out thing with the script file. Another harsh lesson learned was making sure that you're in the directory that you want to be in to remove temporary files when you execute "sudo rm *" and not your home directory. I can't stress enough the importance of this.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="codebox">
				<p>Here's a few short examples of single line sed and awk commands</p>
				<pre>
					<code class="coding">$ sed -n ‘/:[1-9]*\/[1-7]\/[[:digit:]]/p’ datebook
# RegEx is your friend as I've said before. With sed you do need to change things up a bit in order for it to work properly and not just 
# how you would generate it in it's usual format.

$ sed ‘/^$/d’ datebook
# Deleting is pretty straight forward with the "d" instruction. This short command looks at the beginning and end to see if the line is 
# empty and then will remove it for when it gets printed out

$ awk -F “:” ‘/Frodo|Tom/ {print $2}’ AwkLab.data
# Using -F to change the field delimiter helps with finding and displaying just Frodo and Toms phone numbers

$ awk ‘length($1) (less than sign)= 4 {print $1}’ AwkLab.data
# Printing out whatever entries in the first column that are under 4 characters long

$ awk -F”:” ‘{print$1 “  “$2 “  “ $3}’ AwkLab.data | awk ‘$NF (less than sign)= 75 ‘{print $2” “$3” “$4$5}’
# Piping together commands helps narrow your results down even further to get you the info requested

$ awk ‘sub{(/(Samwise Gamgee)/, “Sean Astin”); print $0}’ AwkLab.data
# Using a sub string to change out a first and last name with another first and last name
					</code>
				</pre>
			</div>
				
			<div id="codebox">
				<p>This is my attempt at an awk script. There are three loops in here, one is for listing anyone with the last name Took and the sum of their individual contributions. The second is to retrieve all of Bullroarers contributions. Lastly is to retrieve all the names of people in the dataset that contributed more than $175 in the last month. Below the code you can see the what the script printed out. Though the information is there, I couldn't let that be the end of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/keith-reagan/keith-reagan.github.io/blob/main/scripts/facts.awk">the script.</a> </p>

				<p>After doing some research and consulting a friend I was able to get <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/keith-reagan/keith-reagan.github.io/blob/main/scripts/betterFacts.awk">the script.</a> output looking legible. With awk loops it doesn't act like how you expect it would. Instead, it will read your dataset and run each line against all the loops and output the information to the screen or file before moving to the next line the dataset and repeating until complete. To compensate for this each loop was brought into an array using sprint so it would not be printed to the screen and saved until the END statement. Here a header would be printed out and a for loop would exhaust any content in the array printing that to the screen as well.</p>
